## Introduction

This project is intended to be a simple Snake Clone in C++ (Hence the name Cnake) for learning purposes, 
to get familiar with C++ Game Development, the Vulkan Graphics API and Game Engine Development.
I say Engine/Vulkan develompent because this game is using my own engine, [river](https://github.com/flymandi/river).

I plan to expand on classic Snake with some features and/or changes compared to the original gameplay loop. 

#### The plan
| Element                    | Status        |
| ---                        | ---           |
| Project Structure          | Done          |
| Snake Asset                | Done          |
| Basic Movement & collision | Not Started   |
| Scoring System             | Not Started   |
| Gameplay Expansion         | Not Started   |
